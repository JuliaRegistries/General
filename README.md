# General: the official registry of general Julia packages

Please read the 
[`Registrator.jl` README](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl/blob/master/README.md) 
for instructions on how to register a Julia package.

If your registration meets the 
[automerge guidelines](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/RegistryCI.jl/blob/master/README.md#automatic-merging-guidelines), 
it will be automatically merged. Otherwise, it will require manual review by a human.
